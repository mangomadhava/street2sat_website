### Geography
**Location** <sup>[1]</sup>
Eastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean, between Somalia and Tanzania

**Area** <sup>[1]</sup>
- Total: 580,367 sq km
- Land: 569,140 sq km
- Water: 11,227 sq km

**Landscape** <sup>[3]</sup>
Geographic Regions
1. Lake Victoria Basin: part of a plateau rising eastward from the lakeshore to the Rift highlands.
2. Great Rift Valley & Associated Highlands: splits the highland region into two sections: Mau Escarpment to the west & Aberdare Range to the east. Valley itself is 30 to 80 miles (50 to 130 km) wide. Important in historic & economic development, this region was focus of European settlement.
3. Eastern Plateau Forelands: just east of Rift highlands, constitute a vast plateau of ancient rocks gently sloping to the coastal plain, scattered hills & striking elevated formations
4. North & Northeast Semi-arid/Arid Regions: vast region extending from Ugandan border through Lake Rudolf to the plateau area between the Ethiopian and Kenyan highlands, movement of people & livestock is limited by availability of water
5. Coastal Region: runs for about 250 miles (400 km) along the Indian Ocean, mangrove swamps, low-lying coastal areas

**Terrestrial Ecoregions**
1. Guinean forest-savanna mosaic
2. Sahelian Acacia savanna
3. West Sudanian savanna
4. Guinean mangroves

**Land Use** <sup>[1]</sup>
- Agricultural land: 48.1% (2018 est.)
- Arable land: 9.8% (2018 est.)
- Permanent crops: 0.9% (2018 est.)
- Permanent pasture: 37.4% (2018 est.)
- Forest: 6.1% (2018 est.)
- Other: 45.8% (2018 est.)

**Climate**
- Varies from tropical along coast to arid in interior
- Seasonal climatic changes controlled by large-scale pressure systems of western Indian Ocean and adjacent landmasses
- Long rain season: March to May
- Short rain season: October to November

**Natural Resources** <sup>[1]</sup>
Limestone, Soda ash, Salt, Gemstones, Fluorspar, Zinc, Diatomite, Gypsum, Wildlife, Hydropower

**Soils**
- In northwest soils are highly favorable for peanut cultivation
- Center and South of the country have a layer of laterite hidden under sand which affords sparse grazing in rainy season
- Near river mouths soils are salty and favorable for grazing

**Other Facts** <sup>[1]</sup>
- Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa
- Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa
- Unique physiography supports abundant/varied wildlife
- Kenya shares a part of Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical lake & the second largest fresh water lake
