### Geography
**Location** <sup>[1]</sup>
- Eastern Africa
- Bordering the Indian Ocean
- Between Somalia & Tanzania

**Area** <sup>[1]</sup>
- Total: 580,367 sq km
- Land: 569,140 sq km
- Water: 11,227 sq km

**Landscape** <sup>[3]</sup>
1. Lake Victoria Basin: part of a plateau rising eastward from the lakeshore to the Rift highlands
2. Great Rift Valley & Associated Highlands: splits the highland region into two sections: Mau Escarpment to the west & Aberdare Range to the east, valley itself is 30 to 80 miles (50 to 130 km) wide, important in historic & economic development, region was focus of European settlement
3. Eastern Plateau Forelands: just east of Rift highlands, constitute a vast plateau of ancient rocks gently sloping to the coastal plain, scattered hills & striking elevated formations
4. North & Northeast Semi-arid/Arid Regions: vast region extending from Ugandan border through Lake Rudolf to the plateau area between the Ethiopian and Kenyan highlands, movement of people & livestock is limited by availability of water
5. Coastal Region: runs for about 250 miles (400 km) along the Indian Ocean, mangrove swamps, low-lying coastal areas

**Land Use**

CIA Factbook <sup>[1]</sup>
- Agricultural land: 48.1% (2018 est.)
- Arable land: 9.8% (2018 est.)
- Permanent crops: 0.9% (2018 est.)
- Permanent pasture: 37.4% (2018 est.)
- Forest: 6.1% (2018 est.)
- Other: 45.8% (2018 est.)

FAO Stat Ag Land Use (2021) <sup>[6]</sup>
```
Total: 58.037 Mha
└── Agricultural: 27.71 Mha (47.7% of total)
    ├── Cropland: 6.410 Mha (11.0% of total)
    │   ├── Arable: 5.8 Mha (10.0% of total)
    │   │   ├── Temporary crops: 4.197 Mha
    │   │   └── Temporary fallow: 0.648 Mha
    │   └── Permanent crops: 0.610 Mha
    └── Permanent meadows & pastures: 21.3 Mha
```
**Climate**
- Varies from tropical along coast to arid in interior
- Seasonal climatic changes controlled by large-scale pressure systems of western Indian Ocean and adjacent landmasses
- Long rain season: March to May
- Short rain season: October to November

**Soils**
- In northwest soils are highly favorable for peanut cultivation
- Center and South of the country have a layer of laterite hidden under sand which affords sparse grazing in rainy season
- Near river mouths soils are salty and favorable for grazing

**Other Facts** <sup>[1]</sup>
- Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa
- Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa
- Unique physiography supports abundant/varied wildlife
- Kenya shares a part of Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical lake & the second largest fresh water lake

**Crop Calendar Summary Comparison**
<!-- - Both crop calendars include: groundnut, maize, millet, sorghum, and rice.
- The USDA FAS crop calendar also includes cotton.
- Both crop calendars show a sowing/planting period from June to August
- Both crop calendars show a harvest period from September to February -->

### Agriculture

**Farming Practices** <sup>[8]</sup>

- Main food crops in Kenya are maize, wheat, rice, potatoes, Green grams, and beans
- Maize is the principal staple food of Kenya and it is grown in 90% of all Kenyan farms
- The common bean and the Irish potato are the second and third most important food crop
- Most crops are grown as intercrop (one main crop planted with a second crop) - very traditional practice
- Most cropping is rainfed
- 75% of Kenyan agriculture is practiced by small holder farmers

**Crop Production** <sup>[9]</sup>
- The annual crop production in Kenya which supports 10 million households is:
-  6 million tons of food crops
- 4.2 million tons of horticultural crops
-  500,000 tons of industrial crops

**Crop Losses** <sup>[10]</sup>

- Crop diseases, pests, and weeds greatly reduce the potential of these crops both in quality and quantity.
- Losses due to these constraints were estimated at over 40% in 2024
- Soil fertility and land degradation are major factors in declining productivity
- Due to low productivity and decline in staple crops like corn, farmers are starting to grow traditional - food crops such as millet, sorghum, bananas, yams, greens and sweet potatoes.
